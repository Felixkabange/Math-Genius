Dependecies to add to make react work in this project first install these: 

npm install react react-dom
npm install @babel/core @babel/preset-react

And then Create a Babel configuration file (babel.config.js):

Create a file named babel.config.js in your project's root directory and add the following configuration:

module.exports = {
  presets: ['@babel/preset-react'],
};

Compile your JavaScript code:

You will need to compile your JavaScript code before using it in the Django template. You can use a build tool like Webpack or Babel to compile your React code into a single JavaScript file.

For example, you can use Webpack to bundle your JavaScript code:

npm install webpack webpack-cli --save-dev

And then: 
<script src="{% static 'path_to_bundle.js' %}"></script>
